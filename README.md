## Synopsis

[GMQL-Importer](https://github.com/DEIB-GECO/GMQL-Importer) gathers information from heterogeneous datasources and integrates them into the [Genomic Data Model (GDM)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202316303012) for further processing using [GenoMetric Query Language (GMQL)](http://www.bioinformatics.deib.polimi.it/genomic_computing/)

## Motivation

[GMQL-Importer](https://github.com/DEIB-GECO/GMQL-Importer) is meant to be the interface between the [GMQL-Repository](https://github.com/DEIB-GECO/GMQL/tree/master/GMQL-Repository) and the different sources used in the [GMQL Project](https://github.com/DEIB-GECO/GMQL), these different sources can have many data formats and procedures to obtain them

## Repository Structure

  * [GMQLImporter Base Components](https://github.com/akaitoua/GMQL/tree/master/GMQL-Importer/src/main/scala/it/polimi/genomics/importer/GMQLImporter)

  * TO BE COMPLETED...

## Installation

The full [GMQL Project](https://github.com/DEIB-GECO/GMQL) can be pulled from the GitHub repository, installation of its dependencies is done by [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
The project still under development and no "user" installation is available right now, in order to set this up in your machine and help us in the development [GMQL Local deployment for developers Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ZnvL7vMJHZY5sNy3lcP-HidlCdxcLPfIwCD2nBAxvc/edit?usp=sharing) is being developed

## Example

Once you have downloaded and installed [GMQL Project](https://github.com/akaitoua/GMQL) inside the [Source Folder](https://github.com/DEIB-GECO/GMQL-Importer/tree/master/src/main/scala/it/polimi/genomics/importer), there is an [example](https://github.com/DEIB-GECO/GMQL-Importer/tree/master/Example) to run and check the basic functionallity of GMQL-Importer
